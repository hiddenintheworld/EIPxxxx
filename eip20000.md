## Simple Summary
This proposal introduces an additional transaction feature to Ethereum's current consensus mechanism based on EIP1559. The feature allows transactions to expire after a certain period if they are not mined, enabling users to cancel transactions without having to replace them with a new one and pay a higher gas price.

## Abstract

We propose the introduction of a time-based transaction expiration mechanism in Ethereum. The mechanism would allow users to set an expiration block number for their transactions, after which the transaction would expire and be removed from the mempool. This would give users more control over their transactions and reduce unnecessary network traffic caused by failed transactions.

The expiration block number would be a parameter that users could set while creating their transactions. If the transaction is not included in a block before the expiration block number, it would expire, and the gas used for the transaction would be refunded to the sender's account. This would ensure that users are not charged for transactions that are not processed and also reduce the load on the network.

This EIP proposes the introduction of a new transaction type, based on EIP-2718, with a new format: 0x02 || rlp([chain_id, nonce, expiry_block_number, max_priority_fee_per_gas, max_fee_per_gas, gas_limit, destination, amount, data, access_list, signature_y_parity, signature_r, signature_s]).

This new transaction type includes an expiry block number, which can be set by the sender. A transaction will only be valid if the current block number is less than or equal to the expiry block number. The transaction specifies the expiry block number as the deadline for when the transaction is valid. If the expiry block number is reached, the transaction will fail, and no gas fee will be paid.

## Motivation
Ethereum has had a significant number of failed transactions, leaving users with no option but to replace transactions with a higher gas fee and 21000 gas limit transaction (ETH native transaction). This process is inefficient, and there is no way for a transaction to timeout and not be mined once it is sent to the mempool. 

* **Lack of flexbility for user**: It can be incredibly frustrating to be unable to cancel an unnecessary transaction, especially when using platforms like Uniswap to swap tokens or when buying NFTs.
* **Network traffic with useless transaction meant to fail**: In the absence of a transaction expiration mechanism, these failed transactions can remain in the mempool for extended periods of time, leading to unnecessary network traffic. Furthermore, these failed transactions can create network congestion and make it more difficult for other transactions to be processed in a timely manner.

This proposal aims to provide a solution to this inefficiency. With the introduction of an expiry block number, transactions can expire if they are not mined within a specific period, providing users with more flexibility to cancel 

## Specification

Transaction is only valid if the expiration_block_number is greater than or equal to the current block number, the transaction is considered expired and cannot be included in the block otherwise. 

Block validity is defined in the reference implementation below.
The `NUMBER` (`0x43`) opcode **REPRESENT** the `block.number` as defined in the reference implementation below.

As of `FORK_BLOCK_NUMBER`, a new [EIP-2718](./eip-2718.md) transaction is introduced with `TransactionType` 2.

The [EIP-2718](./eip-2718.md) `TransactionPayload` for this transaction is `rlp([chain_id, nonce, expiration_block_number, max_priority_fee_per_gas, max_fee_per_gas, gas_limit, destination, amount, data, access_list, signature_y_parity, signature_r, signature_s])`.

The `signature_y_parity, signature_r, signature_s` elements of this transaction represent a secp256k1 signature over `keccak256(0x02 || rlp([chain_id, nonce, expiration_block_number, max_priority_fee_per_gas, max_fee_per_gas, gas_limit, destination, amount, data, access_list]))`.

The [EIP-2718](./eip-2718.md) `ReceiptPayload` for this transaction is `rlp([status, cumulative_transaction_gas_used, logs_bloom, logs])`.

## Backwards Compatibility
This proposal is backwards compatible with existing Ethereum transactions. It is an optional feature that is only included in transactions that utilize the new format specified in this EIP.


## Security Considerations
### Potentially be exploited by malicious actors
The introduction of an expiry block number feature could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to attempt to invalidate transactions that are still valid. However, this risk is mitigated by setting a minimum block number limit on the expiry block number, which will ensure that transactions remain valid for a reasonable amount of time.

### Nodes gatekeeping
Additionally, nodes on the Ethereum network can enforce a maximum block number limit for expiry block numbers to further reduce the risk of exploitation.
